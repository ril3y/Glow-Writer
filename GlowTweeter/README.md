This is the code to write any tweets you subsribe to on your Glow Writer.

Edit all of your twitter api keys to YOUR values.  Once that is done. Look for: <br>
<code=python>streamer.statuses.filter(track = '#glowwriter', stall_warnings=True)</code>
<br>And change any the glowwriter to any hash tag you wish.  However #glowwriter is epic. (no one uses it sad face)
